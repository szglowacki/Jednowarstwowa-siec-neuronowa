History

Richmond was erected in 1853 from the western part of Woodstock Parish.[6]
Boundaries

Richmond Parish is bounded on the west by the international border, on the north by the Meduxnekeag River, on the east by the second tier of land grants west of the Saint John River, and on the south by a line true east from Boundary Monument No. 1 to the Eel River, then downstream to the Woodstock Parish line.[2]
